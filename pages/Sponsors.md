<p>A special thanks to the awesome companies that contributed all the great prizes. </p>

####Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s  
Purveyors of pure dairy bliss. Not only do they have the best flavor names, they have the best flavors. Cherry Garcia, Heath Bar Crunch, Half Baked &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t get any better than this, folks. Plus, they&rsquo;re from VT, so you know it&rsquo;s good.

####Sunskis 
Shades as useful as they are attractive. Resurrected from Australian surf culture of yesteryear, these stylish sunglasses offer something very few high-quality shades can &ndash; affordability. 

####Blue Bottle  
The coffee of coffee drinkers. There&rsquo;s good reason Blue Bottle is noted as a &lsquo;must do&rsquo; during your visit to the Bay Area. Even in the land of artisanal coffee, Blue Bottle stands head and shoulders above the competition. If you can&rsquo;t make it to one of the cafes treat yourself to some of their delectable beans.

####Clifbar 
Delicious, organic, and portable energy you can feel good about consuming. For anyone that needs sustenance to go and cares about what they&rsquo;re putting in their body.
