<h4>What’s all this for, anyway? </h4> 
<p>This summer I’ll be joining a Bike & Build trip and peddling from Maine to California.  Bike & Build is a non-profit organization that raises money and awareness for affordable housing through biking trips.  In addition to fundraising, we’ll be giving community presentations and volunteering on affordable housing developments along the way.  </p>

<h4>Why Bike & Build? </h4>
If I’m going to bike across the country I want to do it for a good cause, and I can’t think of a better one than affordable housing.   It’s an issue I care deeply about and one that I’ve spent the entirety of my career working towards.  After hearing wonderful things from friends who have been on previous Bike & Build trips it was an easy choice.

<h4>What happens to the donations?</h4>
Bike & Build will distribute nearly half a million dollars to affordable housing organizations across the U.S. this year thanks to generous donations from folks like you.  Bike & Build does use a small percentage of the contributions to keep the lights on and the organization running.  If you’re into reading 990’s, <a href=http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9184/368/> they’ve got an impressive one.</a>   Thanks to on the road donations and free accommodations (mostly churches and community centers) trip costs are kept to a bare minimum.  After looking behind the scenes I think you would be hard pressed to find a leaner organization.  Your donations are in great hands.
