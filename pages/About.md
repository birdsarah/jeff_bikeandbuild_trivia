####What's all this for, anyway?
This summer Jeff Goodwin will be helping to lead a Bike & Build trip.  Along with 33 other young adults, heâ€™ll be peddling 1000 miles from Portland, OR to Bellingham WA. Bike & Build is a non-profit organization that raises money and awareness for affordable housing through biking trips. In addition to fundraising, Bike & Build trips stop to volunteer with affordable housing orgs along the way.

####Why Bike & Build?
Bike & Build is a small but mighty organization.  They have a profound impact on participants, communities along the route, and partner affordable housing organizations.  
Affordable housing is an important - and largely hidden - issue that demands our attention.  Bike & Build provides an opportunity to raise funds and awareness for this cause in a meaningful way, engaging young adults in the process. 
To date, Bike & Build has donated more than $5.1M; built for more than 185,000 hours; pedaled over 8.5M miles; and engaged more than 2250 young adults.



####What happens to the donations?
Bike & Build will distribute
nearly half a million dollars to affordable housing organizations across the
U.S. this year thanks to generous donations from folks like you.  Bike & Build
does use a small percentage of the contributions to keep the lights on and the
organization running.  If you're into reading 990's, <a
href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9184/368/"> they've got an
impressive one.</a>   Thanks to on the road donations and free accommodations
(mostly churches and community centers) trip costs are kept to a bare minimum.
After looking behind the scenes I think you would be hard pressed to find a
leaner organization.  Your donations are in great hands. 


####I want to donate but all this guessing makes me uncomfortable.
Not a problem.  You can still donate to my fundraising efforts directly on
<a href="http://bikeandbuild.org/rider/7760">Bike &amp; Build&rsquo;s website</a>, or by snail mailing in a check to:

####Fine print: 
This isn&rsquo;t gambling. This isn&rsquo;t betting. If you&rsquo;re looking to make money or win big, this isn&rsquo;t for you. In fact, if you&rsquo;re reading the fine print, this might not be for you.

If there's a tie, the prize will be offered to the most generous donor (whoever donated the most to Jeff&rsquo;s Bike  &amp; Build account).
