####What's all this for, anyway?
This summer I'll be joining a Bike &
Build trip and peddling from Maine to California.  Bike & Build is a non-profit
organization that raises money and awareness for affordable housing through
biking trips.  In addition to fundraising, we'll be giving community
presentations and volunteering on affordable housing developments along the
way.

####Why Bike & Build?
If I'm going to bike across the country I want
to do it for a good cause, and I can't think of a better one than affordable
housing.   It's an issue I care deeply about and one that I've spent the
entirety of my career working towards.  After hearing wonderful things from
friends who have been on previous Bike & Build trips it was an easy choice.   


####What happens to the donations?
Bike & Build will distribute
nearly half a million dollars to affordable housing organizations across the
U.S. this year thanks to generous donations from folks like you.  Bike & Build
does use a small percentage of the contributions to keep the lights on and the
organization running.  If you're into reading 990's, <a

impressive one.</a>   Thanks to on the road donations and free accommodations
(mostly churches and community centers) trip costs are kept to a bare minimum.
After looking behind the scenes I think you would be hard pressed to find a
leaner organization.  Your donations are in great hands. 

####Who is Jeff Goodwin?
You've gotten this far and we haven't met?
That's wonderful news.  I hope we meet in the near future, and until then,
thanks for supporting my fundraising efforts.  You can learn more about me and
