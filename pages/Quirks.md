###Quirks!

Hi, really sorry you've ended up here. We haven't had time to iron out all the kinks.

Generally speaking the number one thing is to write numbers as just numbers e.g.

* <span class="text-success">4000</span> not <span class="text-danger">4,000</span>
* <span class="text-success">1000000</span> not <span class="text-danger">1,000,000</span>

Also, browsers should give you a warning if you try and enter text instead of a number, but 
some aren't (e.g. Safari on some versions of OSX), so please try and always use numbers e.g.

* <span class="text-success">3</span> not <span class="text-danger">three</span>
* <span class="text-success">50</span> not <span class="text-danger">fifty</span>

Decimals are fine, so you can say things like:

* <span class="text-success">10.234</span>
